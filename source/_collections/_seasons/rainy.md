Rainy season starts in India in the month of July when winds of South West Monsoon starts blowing. According to the Hindi month it falls in Asadha and Shawan. Everyone enjoy it a lot as environment becomes so clear, cool and clean because of the fresh air and rainy water. Plants, trees and grasses become so green and look very attractive. New leaves are arising to the plans and trees as they get natural water after a long time of hottest summer. The whole environment gives a greenery look all around which is very nice for the eyes.[^1]

Rainy season brings my lots of favourite festivals like Raksha Banhan, 15 August, Teej, Dussehra, etc. We also enjoy eating lots of fresh fruits and well ripe mangoes in this season. I never want to lose this season. My mom cook lots of delicious dishes (such as pakaude, edli, halwa, tea, coffee, sandwich, etc) to us while its raining.
