## Introduction

This is a jekyll theme which has been built from ground up to resemble [lanyon theme](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/). Currently, it doesnot support all the features of lanyon theme (like sidebar positioning)

## Download

The source code of the project is available on Github. You can get the source code from [here](https://github.com/sonapraneeth-a/reboot-lanyon/tree/master).

Please refer to [link]({{site.baseurl}}/blog/2018/02/12/reboot-lanyon/) for instructions on how to use and features available in the current theme.

Thanks!
