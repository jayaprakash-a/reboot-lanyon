- title: Autonomous Imaging of Unknown Planar Structures using Quadcopters
  subtitle: Drones
  guide: Prof. Sharat Chandran
  institution: 
  date: July, 2017
  course: M.Tech Project
  abstract: Our goal in this work is to set up an autonomous flying machine to take orthographic pictures of large multiple planar surfaces. The multiplanar structure has the property that no single view-point with a limited field of view is sufficient to 'see' all the planar surfaces. This implies that we need multiple points, usually several, to 'walk' around these surfaces.
  brief: In this project we use quadcopters for imaging unknown planar structures
